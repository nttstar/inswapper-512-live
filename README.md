# A Mac Silicon Demo of inswapper-512-live model

:bulb: **Move to https://github.com/deepinsight/inswapper-512-live** :bulb:

**``inswapper-512-live``** is an ultra-lightweight face swapping model that provides native 512x512 resolution. It requires less than 1/10 of the computational complexity of ``inswapper_128``, yet it can output images with 16 times the pixel count (512x512 vs 128x128).

Coming soon.
